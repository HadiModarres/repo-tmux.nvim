# repo-tmux.nvim

Work effectively with multiple git repositories in Neovim by attaching to tmux sessions.

## Problem

You find yourself jumping to and working with many different git repositories and need terminals for each repository.
You dedicate tmux sessions to each repository and launch Neovim from inside tmux sessions.

<b>The issues with this setup are</b>:

- You find yourself having too many Neovim instances open across different tmux sessions. This can cause using a lot of memory, especially
  when you use LSPs.

- Jumping between tmux sessions to read code for other repositories is tiring.

## Solution

This plugin provides a way to access the tmux session for each repository from Neovim. So you only need to have one Neovim instance open.
